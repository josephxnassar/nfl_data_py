## Initialization

```python
ESPNDepthChart()
```

### Attributes:
- `teams` (`list[str]`): List of NFL team abbreviations used to construct URLs for scraping ESPN.

---

## Methods

### `_get_soup(team: str)`

Sends an HTTP GET request to the ESPN depth chart page for a given team and returns a BeautifulSoup of the HTML.

#### Parameters:
- `team` (`str`): Team abbreviation (e.g., `"DAL"` for the Dallas Cowboys).

#### Returns:
- `BeautifulSoup`: Parsed HTML soup object.

#### Raises:
- Exits the program if an `HTTPError` is encountered.

---

### `_parse_soup(soup: BeautifulSoup) -> tuple`

Parses the two tables from the soup object to extract positions and players.

#### Parameters:
- `soup` (`BeautifulSoup`): Parsed HTML from the team depth chart page.

#### Returns:
- `tuple`: A tuple containing a list of positions and a list of player names.

---

### `_create_depth_chart(positions: list, players: list) -> pd.DataFrame`

Organizes the scraped position and player data into a structured DataFrame for positions of interest.

#### Parameters:
- `positions` (`list`): List of player positions.
- `players` (`list`): Flattened list of player names.

#### Returns:
- `pd.DataFrame`: A DataFrame indexed by position with columns for starter, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th string players.

---

### `get_depth_charts() -> dict`

Constructs depth charts for all NFL teams defined in `self.teams`. Each request is delayed randomly to avoid overloading the server.

#### Returns:
- `dict`: Dictionary mapping each team abbreviation to its corresponding depth chart DataFrame.

## Example Usage

```python
from core import ESPNDepthChart
from core import Excel

espn = ESPNDepthChart()
excel = Excel("output_file.xlsm")
excel.output_dfs(espn.get_depth_charts(), "output_sheet")
excel.close()
```
